						<p> I am writing to share my deep passion for Web Development and the exciting projects I have had the privilege to work on during my internship program.

Throughout my journey in the field of web development, I have undertaken various projects that have allowed me to gain hands-on experience and refine my skills. Among these projects were a series of small yet impactful applications, including a captivating Landing page, a practical Simple calculator, an efficient To-do list app, and a user-friendly Temperature converter website.

One of my most noteworthy achievements was successfully building an exact clone of the renowned Netflix website, meticulously crafting its design and layout using HTML and CSS. Additionally, I took on the challenge of developing a Book Database System, leveraging the power of Node.js and MongoDB to create a seamless and robust platform for managing books and related data.
